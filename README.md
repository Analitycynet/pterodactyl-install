# Pterodactyl Install Script
A up-to-date and good Pterodactyl install script. This script is updated as soon as a new version is released. Please read through the code, and tell me how to improve.

The script will **NEVER** try to compromise your machine in any means. I don't believe in paywalls, nor charging someone for something as simple as a shell script.

# Getting started

Note: If you're not Root, please run all commands as sudo.

Run ```bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/upstreamsea/pterodactyl-install/master/install.sh)```, then follow the simple setup process.

# Issues?
