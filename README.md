# Pterodactyl Install Script
A up-to-date and good Pterodactyl install script. This script is updated as soon as a new version is released. Please read through the code, and tell me how to improve.

The script will **NEVER** try to compromise your machine in any means. I don't believe in paywalls, nor charging someone for something as simple as a shell script.

# Getting started

Note: If you're not Root, please run all commands as sudo.

To start the process, retrieve the ```install.sh``` script by using ```git clone https://github.com/upstreamsea/pterodactyl-install.git```

Once cloned, give the folder recursive permissions via using ```chmod -R 0755 pterodactyl-install```

After the correct permissions are granted, run ```./pterodactyl-install/install.sh```, then follow the simple setup process.
